It is a port of GameSWF. Orginal version http://tulrich.com/geekstuff/gameswf.html

Advanced cross-platform GUI solution for parsing and rendering SWF movies, using 3D hardware APIs for rendering. It is designed to be used as a UI library for video games.

It is written in C++, and compiles under Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android, using GCC and MSVC. It includes code for rendering with OpenGL ES. The rendering module is factored out so that the code can be ported to other APIs.
